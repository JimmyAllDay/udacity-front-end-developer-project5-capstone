Node, Express.js, Sass, various webpack loaders and plugins.

Shut up, it runs.

Instructions:

1. Clone the repository

2. Run npm install in the project directory

3. For development, run 'npm run nodemon' and, in another terminal window 'npm run build-dev'.
   This will start a development environment with hot reloading, etc.

4. For prod, run 'npm run build-prod', then 'npm start'
   This will build a production version of the app and serve it via Node. The Node server listens on port 8080.
